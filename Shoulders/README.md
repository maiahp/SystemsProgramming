To run this program, one must simply compile it and run it. The first argument must be a number which represents number of lines. The next arguments are optional file names (any number) from which the program will read. Instead of a filename, a dash is also acceptable, which represents reading from standard input. If no files are present, program will read the desired number of lines from standard input.
